## Notable Features
Duck Tycoon implements a functional in-game stock exchange that allows players to compete and interact with each other to make the best market decisions. The in-game exchange updates in real-time to accurately reflect supply and demand across all players. The banking system allows players to optimize their investments and introduces a risk-averse way to build capital. Additionally, there is an option to pursue further education or directly enter the workforce. This decision has a pivotal impact on gameplay and allows players to customize their experience.


## Inspiration
Financial responsibility is one of the biggest hurdles that all young adults have to face as they become independent individuals in society. Duck Tycoon was created as an attempt to lower that barrier and help young adults transition into the next stage of their lives. We wanted to create an informative game that was not only fun to play, but an accurate emulation of the financial decisions that we face in real life. Investing, in particular, can be a daunting field to enter without experience. Duck Tycoon bridges this gap and serves as a gentle and engaging introduction to the necessary concepts utilized in managing personal finance. 

Why ducks? ducks are cool :)
